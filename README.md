# Beginner Portfolio Website

This repository contains a very simple personal portfolio website built with basic HTML and CSS (and optional JavaScript) to practice and improve web development skills.

## Project Overview

The website is a static multi-page portfolio with sections for a home/intro page, a list of projects, a skills page, and a contact page. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand page structure, navigation links, and simple layouts.

## Features

- Home page with a short introduction and navigation to other sections.
- Projects page showcasing small practice projects like a calculator, to-do list, and login page.
- Skills page listing basic programming languages and web technologies.
- Contact page with a simple form or contact details so visitors can reach out.

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structuring all pages (index, projects, skills, contact).
- CSS for basic styling, layout, and typography.
- (Optional) JavaScript for simple interactions on small practice projects like calculator or to-do list.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the portfolio homepage.
3. Use the navigation links to move between the Projects, Skills, and Contact pages.

## Learning Goals

- Practice writing clean, well-structured HTML for multiple pages.
- Improve basic CSS skills for styling text, sections, and navigation menus.
- Build confidence in organizing a small web project and documenting it with a simple README.

## Future Improvements

- Add responsive design so the site looks better on mobile devices.
- Enhance styling with more advanced CSS or frameworks.
- Add more projects and update the skills and contact information as experience grows.
